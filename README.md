# honor-paths

READ THIS FIRST:
The honor point calculations are from early 2017 and may therefore be incorrect in our current patch. The numbers were found on Zeth'Kur.

How to use:
1. Run the honor.py-file in any Python interpreter, version 3.3 or newer. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Follow the console prompts, i.e. Enter your current honor. (e.g. 678999)
3. Enter your cap. (e.g. 700000)
4. The program should automatically open a webpage with your details - But if not, simply go to the folder of the program and look for honor paths.htm

How to read:
Top line is number of marks you will need AFTER you reach your "pre-cap" using the combinations below.
The following lines are possible combinations to get to your cap.

BE CAREFUL:
Because of limited test data, not everything is deemed as safe. Unsafe data are marked with (unsafe). Use these paths carefully!

Last but not least, don't be stupid!
