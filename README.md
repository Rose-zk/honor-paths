# honor-paths
Old program I made for when I was in the ranking scene. 

READ THIS FIRST:
The honor point calculations are from early 2017 and may therefore be incorrect in our current patch. The numbers were found on Zeth'Kur.

How to use:
1. Start the program in any Python interpreter 3.3 or newer.
2. Enter your current honor.
3. Enter your cap.
4. The program should automatically open a webpage with your details, but if not, simply go to the folder of the program and look for honor paths.htm

How to read:
Top line is number of marks you will need AFTER you reach your "pre-cap" using the combinations below.
The following lines are possible combinations to get to your cap.

BE CAREFUL:
Because of limited test data, not everything is deemed as safe, these are marked with (unsafe). Use these carefully!
